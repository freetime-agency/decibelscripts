this script in /getSpotifyDataForArtist will submit one API call to Spotify to get the artist's information.

It will then output the information as a JSON object.

On the page called spotify-artist.html, there is a form with a text input and a button. 

The text that will be inputted will be the Spotify artist link: https://open.spotify.com/artist/5FKchcZpQOkqFvXBj1aCvb

The last part of the link, 5FKchcZpQOkqFvXBj1aCvb, is the Spotify ID.

The API call will be:
endpoint: https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/{id}

Reference the createWeeklySpotifyAllPlaylist.js file for the API call information like auth

Output all of the information from the href as a JSON object.
